    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Zeke Lieberman and I am a music artist from the Philadelphia area.  I release under the name Summer Thunder.  I have a classical musical background and grew up playing the cello as well as drum kit, both of which I have been playing for over ten years.  I also play guitar.  I write my own music, where I specialize in rock and punk styles.  I am also maintaining cello performance as a side hobby.  I can play gigs such as weadings or recording cello tracks for songs.  I am in the process of pursuing a minor in cello performance at Loyola University New Orleans.  I am also studying music Industry at Loyola.</p>
